# Wakey_Tokey_Using_ESP8266
## Technologies
* ESP8266 
* Arduino
* LM386 Audio Amplifier Module

## Project Description
This is ESP8266 Arduino base audio transmission experiment, However project not 100% successful, </br>
Because of ESP8266 has 10-bit inbuilt ADC. It is not enough for sample good quality audio  </br>
24bit DAC and I2S mic require for best experience.
